## Fabian Riess (he/him)


I'm a Berlin based artist and soon to be Web Developer.
My work as a dancer and choreographer has stretched all over Germany and Europe over the past 5 years.
Currently I'm a student at SPICED, getting ready to dance through the world wide web.



## My personal interests include:
- reading political theory
- going for walks without my phone
- travelling to remote places
- eating sugar

On the weekends you will usually find me [like this](https://giphy.com/embed/FBzqZGthkW6KQ)
